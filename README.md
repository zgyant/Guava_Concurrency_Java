# Guava_Concurrency_Java
This is a program that calculates the average, minimum, maximum and most
frequent value for the last 30 numbers of an infinite stream of numbers produced by “n”
threads that generate random numbers between the values of 1 to 10.

It has: 
● The threads that generate the random numbers.
● The inter thread communication method. Uses Google Guava
Concurrency.
● A main method to run the program that lets a user specify the number of random
number generation threads.
